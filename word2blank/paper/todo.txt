Task 1: [RED] Reproduce word2vec (gensim) {Alok}
Task 2: [RED] Reproduce poincare embeddings {Druid}
Task 2: [ORANGE] Implement SGD over Reimannian manifolds

> Generate a formal understanding of word clustering in Word2Vec
> Look into affine transformation from vector spaces

15 Aug 2018:
> Reproduce Word2Vec, Poincare Embeddings and (ElMo?)
> Explore all manifolds that can be trained upon (dimensionality > 3 )

Side Quest:
> How can we prove Word2Vec wrong? a. Adversarial attacks b. Fixing a simensionality to train upon (and adjust dimensioanlity accordingly) to try to find the "meaning" od distance and clustering
